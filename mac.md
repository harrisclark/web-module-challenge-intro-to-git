## Research Questions 

Now that you are all set up, it's time to learn a little more about the tools of the trade. Edit this file and answer the following questions. You are going to need to start familiarizing yourself with the [GitHub docs](https://docs.github.com/en). Docs (short for documentation) are the instructions on how to use a languge or program. A large part of your job as a developer will be learning how to read and work with documentation. Please reference the GitHub docs when answering the questions below. If you cannot find what you are looking for in the docs, you can always start to practice your Google skills!

1. What is Git? A version control manager
2. What is the difference between Git and GitHub? GitHub is a cloud based open source project sharing comunity, and git is the version control software that it uses to track changes
3. Why do we create a branch? So you have your own working project that doesn't make changes the main branch
4. What is the purpose of a Pull Request? To request that the changes you have made be added to the main branch
5. What is the command you can use to switch between branches? For example you are working on FIRSTNAME-LASTNAME branch and you want to switch back to main. 'git checkout -b main'
6. Explain the difference between `git fetch`, `git merge` and `git pull`. What does each command do? 'git fetch' allows you to download and see the changes other people have made to a repository before merging them. 'git merge' will merge the changes you and others have made in your remote repository. From what I understand 'git pull' will merge your changes without first checking the changes other contrubutors have made
7. What is a merge conflict? It's what happens when git cannot automaticly merge the code in two different commits
8. How do you resolve a merge conflict? Manualy make the necessary changes to your code and commit. Then try again
